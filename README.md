## 📄 Abstract

Embodied AI systems interact with the physical world through multi-stage closed-loop processes, enabling capabilities such as spatial understanding, manipulation, and navigation. While recent advances have significantly strengthened these abilities, they also introduce new security vulnerabilities with potentially serious physical consequences. However, adversarial threats in embodied systems remain fragmented and lack a unified analytical framework.

In this survey, we review adversarial attacks and defenses in embodied AI from a closed-loop perspective, analyzing how security risks emerge, propagate, and amplify across embodied systems.

## 📊 Framework

![Framework](framework.pdf)

*Overview of adversarial attacks and defenses in embodied AI from a closed-loop perspective, organized by functional stages and intervention phases.*

## 🎯 Key Contributions

- **Closed-loop taxonomy**: We propose a closed-loop taxonomy that organizes adversarial attacks and defenses by functional stages and intervention phases.
- **Comprehensive review**: We systematically review adversarial attacks, defenses, and evaluation benchmarks under a unified closed-loop lens.
- **Future directions**: We identify key limitations and outline future research directions for secure embodied AI.
